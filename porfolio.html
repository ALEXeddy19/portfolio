            <h4>Web Development</h4>
            With over five years of hands-on experience, I specialize in
            building modern, responsive web applications using HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, and React JS. I’ve partnered with primary schools,
            secondary schools, and universities to craft intuitive, accessible
            UIs that are both visually engaging and functionally robust. From
            landing pages to single-page applications, I ensure clean,
            maintainable code, seamless component architecture, and
            pixel-perfect designs that bring your tech ideas to life.

            <h4>Mobile App Development</h4>
            I also design and develop cross-platform mobile applications with
            rich functionality and polished interfaces. Drawing on best
            practices in UX/UI and performance optimization, I deliver apps that
            delight users on both iOS and Android.<br />
